MHUv2 test Sample
#################

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates how to use Arm Message Handling Unit(MHUv2) for
communicating messages/request services on a heterogeneous architecture
like Alif DevKit Ensemble family of devices. The MHUv2 in the
Arm Corestone-700 architecture supports full duplex message communication,
that has dedicated channels for transmission and reception. The messages
can be communicated along two channels using two message handling units
MHU0 and MHU1 simultaneously.

The testcases,
 * exchange data between two different processors using MHUv2 through
   interrupts.
 * request service (info )from root of trust processor such as Secure Enclave.

Requirements
************

The sample uses the MHUv2 of Corestone 700 architecture to send or
receive messages on the dedicated sender and receiver channels.
Confirmation of MHU messages sent or received are intimated through
interrupts and registered callback functions are called for usage.

This sample has been tested on :ref:`alif_e7_dk_rtss_he`,:ref:`alif_e7_dk_rtss_he`, using
Alif DevKit Ensemble family boards.

Building
********

The code can be found in :zephyr_file:`samples/drivers/ipm/ipm_arm_mhuv2`.

:ref:`alif_e7_dk_rtss_he`

To build the application:

Building SE services testcase.

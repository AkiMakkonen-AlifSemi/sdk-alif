Display Sample
##############

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates drawing basic rectangles on the display. The colors and positions of the rectangles are chosen to help you verify the LCD's orientation and correct RGB bit order. The rectangles are drawn in a clockwise sequence, starting from the top left corner: red, green, blue, and grey. The shade of grey transitions from black to white. If the grey appears too green or red at any point, or if the order of the corners is not as described, the LCD may be endian swapped.

Requirements
************

The sample utilizes the CDC200 IP from TES and the panel. It may also use the MIPI-DSI IP from Synopsys if the serial display application is built from the command line. The panel used in the parallel display case is the ILI6122, while serial panels include ILI9806E (2-lane) and ILI9488 (1-lane) panels. The panel will display content generated by the CDC200.

Supported Targets
*****************

* alif_e7_dk_rtss_hp
* alif_e7_dk_rtss_he
* alif_e1c_dk_rtss_he

Building and Running
********************

To build the display application for a parallel display, use:

.. code-block:: console

   west build

To build the display application for ILI9806E (2-lane) serial display:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -- -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=samples/drivers/display/boards/serial_display_2lane.overlay -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=samples/drivers/display/boards/serial_display.conf

To build the display application for ILI9488 (1-lane) serial display:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -- -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=samples/drivers/display/boards/serial_display_1lane.overlay -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=samples/drivers/display/boards/serial_display.conf

It also contains the west.yml needed to fetch all the needed modules and submodules for the SDK.'

# Getting started
If you are already familiar with Zephyr and 'west' tool you need to simply install it and run following command in a (clean) folder of your choice
```
west init -m org-115832732@github.com:AlifSemiDev/sdk-alif; west update
```

Otherwise you should familiarize yourself with Zephyr:
See the [Introduction to Zephyr](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/introduction/index.html) for a high-level overview, and the documentation's [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) to start developing.

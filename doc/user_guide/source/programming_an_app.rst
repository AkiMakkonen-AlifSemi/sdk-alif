Programming an Application
==========================

Alif offers a set of tools that can be used to merge Zephyr images and binaries from different cores.

This process results in a single image known as an Application Table of Contents (ATOC) image.

The ATOC image includes the Zephyr binary images zephyr_e7_rtsshe_helloworld.bin and zephyr_e7_rtsshp_helloworld.bin.

These binaries are for the HE or HP Real-Time SubSystems (RTSS).

The ATOC image is programmed into MRAM, a type of non-volatile memory, using the tools.

Getting the ATOC image onto MRAM consists of the following steps:

1. First, create an application image that contains the Zephyr binary images for the RTSS cores.

2. Next, you should program the ATOC, which includes the application images, into MRAM using the SETOOLS on the host.

3. Once programmed, the applications should print "Hello World!" on the UART4 and UART2 consoles for the RTSS-HE and RTSS-HP, respectively.

Creating ATOC
-------------

To create and deploy an ATOC image containing the application binaries, follow the steps below.

The JSON file (`zephyr_e7_rtsshe_rtsshp_helloworld.json`) is configured to boot these binaries from the ITCM of the RTSS-HE and RTSS-HP on the next power-on reset (POR).

The application binaries are:

   - **RTSS-HE Application binary:** `zephyr_e7_rtsshe_helloworld.bin`
   - **RTSS-HP Application binary:** `zephyr_e7_rtsshp_helloworld.bin`

#. Ensure that you have connected a USB PRG cable between the host and the SE-UART of the DevKit. Please refer to `Alif Hardware Reference Manual`_ for more information.

#. Press the reset button to power on DevKit.

#. Create a JSON file zephyr_e7_rtsshe_rtsshp_helloworld.json for the RTSS-HE and RTSS-HP. You can also use the file with the same filename that was copied into this directory during setup.

   .. note::
      This example assumes that the pre-build binaries containing app-gen-toc, app-write-mram, and updateSystemPackage programs delivered from Alif are located at YOUR_WORKSPACE

   .. code-block:: console

      cd YOUR_WORKSPACE/app-release-exec-linux/
      vi build/config/zephyr_e7_rtsshe_rtsshp_helloworld.json

#. Select the appropriate JSON and binary files based on whether you need ITCM or MRAM configuration.

#. Create an Alif Application image using the app-gen-toc script and choose the above created json.

   .. code-block:: console

     ./app-gen-toc -f build/config/zephyr_e7_rtsshe_rtsshp_helloworld.json

   The above command creates an application image called build/AppTocPackage.bin under the build directory.

Deploying ATOC
--------------

Program Alif application image build/AppTocPackage.bin under the build directory through ISP.

   .. code-block:: console

      ./app-write-mram -p

   .. note::

     a. In the above example, the SE-UART is detected as `/dev/ttyACM0` on the host. Please identify the correct device node using the `dmesg` command.
     b. Please refer to `Alif Security Toolkit Quick Start Guide`_ for more information.

   .. tip::

      Ensure that your user has sufficient access to the `dialout` group for SE-UART device communication.

      - To check if the current user has access, use:

      .. code-block:: console

           groups

      - If `dialout` or `tty` is not in the list, add the user to the `dialout` group with:

      .. code-block:: console

           sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

      - If the device is still not recognized, check for loose connections or try using a different USB port.
